# Assam Tender

This project focuses on predicting tender prices using publicly available Government of Assam tender data.  
The goal is to analyze historical tender information and build a machine learning model that can estimate tender prices based on different features.

## Problem Statement
Government tenders involve large financial decisions. Accurately estimating tender prices can help in:
- Better cost planning
- Detecting abnormal or overpriced tenders
- Supporting data-driven decision making

This project uses historical tender data to predict tender prices using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: Government of Assam public tender data
- Link: https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/assam-public-procurement-data
- Type: Structured tabular data
- Features may include:
  - Department name
  - Tender category
  - Location
  - Tender type
  - Estimated cost
  - Date of issue
  - Completion period

---

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning regression model
- Price prediction based on tender details

---

## FrameWorks and Libraries Used
  - python=3.12
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn
  - jupyter
  - shap

## How It Works
1. Load and clean the tender dataset
2. Handle missing values and outliers
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a regression model
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Predict tender prices for new data
